Rework the upgrade system and add totally new upgrades.



Upgrades are internally in categories, but in game are random



The Upgrades categories are:

1. Projectile Behaviors

2. Elemental Synergies

3. Utility & Economy

4. Defensive & Movement

5. "Cursed" Items

6. Ultimate Evolutions (When attack upgrades are maxed and a passive upgrade is available).

Each Upgrade can be leveled up up to 5 times (6 times/Ultimate Evolution if requirements are met), increasing the effectiveness of the upgrade

Here are the upgrades for each category:

1. Projectile Behaviors

Instead of just adding "more damage," change how the weapons function to create visual spectacle.

 	Fracture / Cluster: Upon hitting an enemy, the projectile splits into 3 smaller, weaker projectiles.

 	Boomerang / Yo-Yo: Projectiles travel a set distance and then return to the player, hitting enemies on the way back (double hit potential).

 	Orbitals: Projectiles don't fire out; they rotate around the player. Upgrades increase the rotation speed and the distance from the player (increasing the "kill zone").

 	Passthrough / Pierce: Projectiles ignore the first $X$ enemies before being destroyed.

 	Ricochet: Projectiles bounce off the map edges or obstacles toward the nearest enemy.


2. Elemental Synergies (Status Effects)

These encourage players to mix and match weapons to create "builds."

 	Voltage (Lightning): Attacks have a chance to chain to nearby enemies.
 		Synergy Idea: If an enemy is "Wet," the lightning range doubles and deals critical damage.

 	Frost (Ice): Chance of Freezing enemy.

 	Corrosion (Acid/Poison): Deals Damage over Time (DoT).

 	Holy / Banishment: Enemies below a certain health percentage (e.g., 10%) are instantly executed (dissolved).

 	Tidal (Water): Inflicts "Wet" status effect and slows down enemy


3. Utility & Economy (The "Greed" Mechanics)
These help the player level up faster or survive, rather than dealing direct damage.

 	Vacuum / Magnet: Increases the range at which you automatically pick up XP gems and gold.

 	XP Fertilizer: XP gems left on the ground for more than 10 seconds grow in value.

 	Reroll / Banish: Passive items that allow the player to reroll level-up choices or "banish" an item so it never appears again (essential for perfecting a build).

 	Gold Rush: Dealing damage generates gold, but enemies move 20% faster for a short duration.


4. Defensive & Movement (Survival)
In the late game, standing still usually means death.

 	Thorns / Spikes: Enemies take damage when they touch your hitbox.

 	Trailblazer: Leaving a trail of fire/acid behind the player as they move.

 	Phase Shift: Taking damage grants 2 seconds of invulnerability (cooldown: 30s).

 	Knockback Wave: A pulse emits from the player every 5 seconds, pushing all enemies back significantly.

 	Radiation: Player radiates toxic green energy and all enemies in the radius of the radiation takes damage.

 	Tesla: Every 10-5 Seconds, summons a thunderbolt to hit a group of enemies (Upgrade decreases time and upgrades 1,2 and 5 upgrade the number of thunderbolts).

5. "Cursed" Items (Risk vs. Reward)
 	These are crucial for high-skill players. They offer massive power at a steep cost. Appears rarely

 	Glass Cannon: Damage +200%, but Max HP is capped at 1.

 	Heavy Metal: Damage +50%, but Movement Speed -20%.

 	Blood Pact: Your weapons deal 2x damage, but firing them drains your HP slowly. You must kill to heal (Life Steal becomes mandatory).

 	Tunnel Vision: Projectiles are 100% bigger, but your pickup range is reduced to zero (you must walk directly over items).

6. Ultimate Evolutions
 "Evolutions" This happens when a player has a Level Max Weapon + a specific Passive Item, and OR MAXED Passive Item + passive Item.

 	Crack Shot (Fracture / Cluster MAXED + Corrosion (Acid/Poison)): Main shot will leave a massive pool of purple poison, and split shots (now 5 instead of 3) will travel a short distance and land, leaving small pools of poison where they land.

 	Molotov: Orbitals MAXED + Trailblazer: Shots now have a 30% chance of splashing 5 molotovs in the shape of a pentagon surrounding the player. Fire left by molotovs deal constant tick damage to enemies and leave "Burning" on enemies for 3 seconds (Burning: Enemies will be set on fire and take damage, X damage every .6 seconds).

 	Update 1-
Add some new features and fix some bugs:

1. New Defensive upgrade: Tesla: Every 10-5 Seconds, summons a thunderbolt to hit a group of enemies (Upgrade decreases time and upgrades 1,2 and 5 upgrade the number of thunderbolts).

2. Every Upgrade will heal a small amount of HP (10% HP Upgrade 1-5, 20% Upgrade 6 and onward).

3. Enemies have a chance of dropping "Meat" on the ground, which heal 30% of player health (XP Fertilizer Upgrade also increases HP gain).

4. New definition for Ultimate Evolutions: " "Evolutions" This happens when a player has a Level Max Weapon + a specific Passive Item, and OR MAXED Direct Damage dealing passive Passive Item (Like Tesla)+ passive Item."

5. New Ultimate Evolution: "Blood Rain" (MAXED Tesla + Blood Pact): Thunderstrikes are now colored red 10% of damage dealt by Tesla's Thunderstrike will now be given as HP to the player

Upgrade Changes:
Knockback Wave: LVL 1 will only have a small knockback, and now upgrades enhance the knock back of Knockback Wave.

Bug Fixes:
1. Laser Beam Powerup has an invisible laser beam and is now visible.
2. Fix Boomerang not working properly.


 	Update 2-

New:

1. Every 5 levels, you gain one reroll.

New Upgrade - Iron Chest: Reduces Damage received by X% (starts at 10% - LVL 5 is 40%

3. Add a pause menu by pressing ESC, which shows your current upgrades, levels, and your upgrade slots.

4. Add a "Upgrade Slots" ui element during the Choose Your Upgrade Pop up, that shows your current upgrades and available slots.

5. Add new visual elements (Bubbles from toxic pools, Sparks erupting from Crackshot poison pools, Voltage have yellow lighting spark effects when chaining from one enemy to another, etc).



Reworks:

1. Gold Rush Rework: Gold Rush now generates XP when dealing damage on an enemy (Chance of getting XP from enemy and XP amount depend on Upgrade LVL).

2. Thorns Rework: Now when a player is hit, physical vines/thorns spike out the player, dealing damage to the enemy (Leveling up upgrade not only increases damage of thorns, but also increases duration of the thorns being sprouted out the player).



Balancing:

1.  Upgrades are now only limited. You can only have 3 Projectile Behaviors upgrades and 5 Elemental Synergies, Utility & Economy, Defensive & Movement,  or "Cursed" Items (passive upgrades). After filling up your slots, you can no longer get new upgrades, only level ups for your current upgrades





1. Knockback Rework/Repulsion's rework is not working.

2. Tesla's thunderbolt has no visuals, should be a blue lighting that strikes the ground/enemy and sparks.

Once a Boss has been defeated, the boss will drop a Boss Chest (Reuse the crate icon and just make it Blue with glowing bloom). A Boss chest contains the Spinning Lottery:
 	Spinning Lottery: A new reward gui that pops up a spinning wheel. This wheel will contain all the upgrades the player currently has in their inventory. The spin button will also pop up.
